# Personal Cryptopals solutions

During the summer after ninth grade I learned about RSA cryptography. But almost as a counter measure, I then did not do any crypto at all all the way through high school and university. This is a shame as it in hindsight would have fit me perfectly, in its combination between programming and mathematics. However, here we are and I don't know anything (in much detail) about crypto.

Recently I found [cryptopals.com](https://cryptopals.com) which seemingly presents several applied cryptography problems, split up into many puzzles. It seems like a perfect way for me to learn about the field. I enjoy these smaller puzzles, and it will gradually force me to learn more and more complicated theory.
