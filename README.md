# Personal Cryptopals solutions

During the summer after ninth grade I learned how to use RSA cryptos. But almost as if I then alrealy knew crypto, I never got further into it. Recently I have realized that there are a lot of fun problems in crypto, and wished I had learnt more about it.

Recently I saw this website [cryptopals.com](cryptopals.com) which seemingly presents several cryptography problems, split up into many puzzles. It seems like the perfect opportunity to get into crypto :D
